## DevOpsCamp initiative

The start point for this repository was a DevOpsCamp initiative - a set of digital training and hands-on activity (and assessment ) to get as much experience as possible. Some topics are for me completely new, so please be indulgent :smile:

All the documents are **NO manuals** - simply tells what I did and how.

If you read this and learn something new (sometimes on my mistakes) that will be great.
